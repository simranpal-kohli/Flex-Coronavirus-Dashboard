# Coronavirus
When the pendemic disease 'Covid-19' was on the verge of spreading like wildfire, many countries adopted lockdown for several months.
During my academic, I intended to do a small project on the visualisation of Corona virus as a very small part of awareness.

# Data Visualisation on Coronavirus:
The visualisation is been build on Rmarkdown with the help of ShinyApp & shinydashboard features, Flex Dashboard, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) API's, ggplots, treemap, 
gganimate etc. libraries & features.
